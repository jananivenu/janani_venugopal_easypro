Automation of project operation functionality -MSDynamics365
Below is the tech stack I have used:
Language:Java
Framework:
Task 1 Cucumber-BDD and Junit with POM
Task 2 TestNG with POM
Build tool:Maven

I have added the Task 1 in main branch where the framework followed is Cucumber and I have created 3 feature files -Submit,Approve and Reject and tied the functionalities to them.

I have added Task 2 in task2 branch where I have followed testng framework and you can run the testng xml from the POM file itself(I have maven surefire plugin)

I am adding word file to mention the issues observed in App.
